This repository contains a child theme coded by me, as part of the course, "WordPress: Custom Posts and Taxonomies" on Lynda.com by Morten Rand-Hendriksen.  

The folders and files the project contain include:

1. <strong>twentyfifteen</strong> - The original twentyfifteen theme from the WordPress directory.
2. <strong>childtheme</strong> - The childtheme folder that contains a custom functions.php, testimonials.php, single-revies.php files. The style.css automatically imports all the CSS from the parent theme.
